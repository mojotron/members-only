# Members Only

Build an exclusive clubhouse where members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is, but outside they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

Goal of this project is practice building express apps, adding authentication and using typescript as additional learning layer.
